    <p>What can we learn from 2.3 Million Taxi Rides?  The MIT Big Data Initiative at CSAIL working in partnership with the City of Boston is hosting a Big Data Challenge seeking to develop innovative prediction algorithms and compelling visualizations of transportation in the Boston area.</p>

<p>"Big Data" is often defined using the 3 V's -- data that is too big (Volume); too fast (Velocity); and too complex (Variety) making it difficult to manage with many of today's processing tools and why researchers are rethinking the systems and tools we need for big data.  For this Challenge, the focus is on "Variety" and the unique set of challenges of integrating and processing multiple diverse data sets of different data types.</p>

<p>This Big Data Challenge provides a unique opportunity to analyze City of Boston taxi data and combine multiple data sets including social media data, transit ridership, events data and weather data to effectively predict demand and better understand patterns in taxi ridership.  We hope this will result in new insights for the City of Boston and the public that will improve transportation in our city (and ability to get a cab when you need one)!</p>

  <div class="textseparator"><h1>Motivation</h1></div>

  
  <p>
The City of Boston is interested in gaining new insights into how people use all modes of transportation travel in and around the downtown Boston area.   A critical imperative of Boston's Complete Streets Policy is to move all modes of transportation more efficiently and to use real-time data to facilitate better trip-planning between modes of transportation.   With urban congestion on the rise, city planners are looking for ways to improve transportation such as providing people with more options to get from one place to another (walking, biking, driving, or using public transit) and by reducing and more efficiently routing vehicles in the city.
  </p>


  <p>
This MIT Big Data Challenge will focus primarily on one mode of public transportation: Taxi Cabs.  By better understanding patterns in taxi ridership, we hope to provide new insights for city planners, such as:
  </p>

  <ul>  
    <li>How to get more cabs where they are needed, when they are needed?
    <li>What are the ideal locations for cab stands?
    <li>When and where should the City add or remove cab stands?
    <li>How many cabs should be waiting around a specific location at a specific time of day?
    <li>Are there viable alternatives to taking a cab?
    <li> Are there easy ways to 'link trips' between cabs and other forms of transportation?
    <li>How does taxi ridership patterns differ on weekdays vs. weekends? Seasonally? During different types of events?
    <li>Where should you go at 1am to catch a cab downtown?
    <li>Do Bruins fans take more cabs than Celtics fans? Does the result of the game impact transportation patterns?
</ul>

  <div class="textseparator"><h1>Competition Overview</h1></div>

  <p>
  The competition is open to individuals or teams.  The only requirement is that one team member must be a member of the MIT community (have an Athena account and MIT certificates).
  </p>

  <p>
  The competition will run from XXX to YYY and focuses on two tasks, prediction and visualization, with separate prizes in each category:
  </p>

  <ul>
  </ul>


  <p>
  The goal is to visualize the taxi  data in an informative, beautiful, or surprising way.  We are particularly interested in visualizations that contrast or compare taxi/public transportation ridership in Downtown and relate them  to nearby events and locales.  Visualizations may include maps, animations or static graphics and ideally should reveal new or interesting trends and patterns.
  We will have a judging panel consisting of visualization experts, data
  scientists, and leaders from the city of Boston's transportation departments.
