  The goal of this challenge is to predict taxi demand (total # of taxi trips) in downtown Boston based on historical taxi data and other related data sets (weather, events, social media data).   
  </div>

  <p> 
  We have collected several months worth of twitter, MBTA, 
  taxi pickup and drop off, and other datasets (see <a href="/datasets">datasets page</a>).  
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In this challenge we will give
  you all of the data except for a number of 2 hour time spans at
  several locations in downtown Boston that we will remove from the
  taxi pickup dataset.  Your job is to predict the total number of
  taxi trips within 250 meters of the locations and the 2 hour time spans. 
  </p>

  <p>We will give you a list of location (latitude, longitude points) and timespan pairs.  Your score will
  be computed as the root-mean-squared error of your predictions against the 
  ground truth.  
  Specifically, given your estimates  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Hat{p_1}\ldots \Hat{p_n}" border="0"/> for data points
   <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_1\ldots p_n" border="0"/>
   we will compute:
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 2em; text-align: center;">
    <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{\sum_{i\in1\ldots n}{(p_i-\Hat{p_i})^2}}}" border="0"/>
  </p>

  
  <p>The pickups used to compute the ground truth at each location and timespan
  will be computed using the following filter:
  <div class='code'>
    ((pickup.lat - location.lat)^2 + (pickup.lon - location.lon)^2) < 0.00224946357 and
     (pickup.time >= timespan.start and pickup.time <= timespan.end)</div>
  </p>

  <h2>Timing</h2>

  <p>We have provided an initial training dataset which includes the
  actual number of taxi pickups on many different days and times
  throughout the city.  In addition, we have provided an initial
  test set of locations, each specified as a lat, lon center
  coordinate and a timestamp.  For each of these points, your code
  needs to predict the number of taxi trips initiated within a 250 m
  radius of the center point and a two hour period following the
  timestamp.<p>

  <p>You can <a href="/prediction_test1">submit</a> predictions for
  this dataset as many times as you wish, and we will provide a
  leaderboard that updates your score on each submission to track
  contestant progress against each other.  The initial test dataset is
  for validation purposes only and has no effect on the final
  evaluation.</p>

  <p>In the last week of the competition, we will release a final test
  dataset on which you will be judged.  You may submit as many times
  as you wish but the final scores will be released only at the end of
  the competition.  The format of this final data set will be the same
  as the test data set but will cover a different set of locations and
  times.</p>
