<p>The prediction challenge will XXX.  We will provide a training
dataset for you to construct models.  Then on YYY date we will
release an initial test dataset and provide N locations, specified
by lat, lon bounding boxes and a time window, for you to predict
the number of taxi routes initiated within the window.  You can
<a href="#submit">submit</a> predictions for this dataset as many times as you
wish, and we will provide a leaderboard that updates your score on
each submission to track contestant progress against each other.
The initial test dataset is for validation purposes only and has
no effect on the final evaluation.</p>

<p>In the last week of the competition, we will release the final test
dataset for which contestants will be ultimately compared.  You may
submit as many times as you wish but the final scores will be release
only at the end of the competition.</p>
