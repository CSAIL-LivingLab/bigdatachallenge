  The goal of this challenge is to predict taxi demand (total # of taxi trips) in downtown Boston based on historical taxi data and other related data sets (weather, events, social media data).

  <p>
  We have collected XXX months worth of data (see below for descriptions
  of the datasets).  We will provide XXX weeks worth of training data
  and draw the test data randomly from XXX weeks of data.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="/datasets"><button>Download the datasets here</button></a></p>

  <p> Demand prediction will be within a specified (0.1 mile) radius
  of key locations in Boston during a specified half hour time
  window  (e.g., between 11 and 11:30pm on March 15, 2013 at the
  intersection of Summer St and Tremont St.).</p>

  <p> The prize will be awarded to the team that most accurately
  predicts (with minimum mean-squared error) ridership at a provided
  set of test locations based on the test data.  </p>

  <p>The prediction challenge will XXX.  We will provide a training
  dataset for you to construct models.  Then on YYY date we will
  release an initial test dataset and provide N locations, specified
  by lat, lon bounding boxes and a time window, for you to predict
  the number of taxi routes initiated within the window.  You can <a
  href="#submit">submit</a> predictions for this dataset as many times
  as you wish, and we will provide a leaderboard that updates your
  score on each submission to track contestant progress against each
  other.  The initial test dataset is for validation purposes only
  and has no effect on the final evaluation.</p>

  <p>In the last week of the competition, we will release the final test
  dataset for which contestants will be ultimately compared.  You may
  submit as many times as you wish but the final scores will be release
  only at the end of the competition.</p>
