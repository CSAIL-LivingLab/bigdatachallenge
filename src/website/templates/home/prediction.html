  The goal of this challenge is to predict taxi demand (total # of taxi trips) in downtown Boston based on historical taxi data and other related data sets (weather, events, social media data).

  <p>
  We have collected 2 months worth of data (see below for descriptions
  of the datasets).  In this challenge we will give you all of the data
  except for several days of taxi data that we leave out.  Your job is 
  to predict the total number of taxi trips within a number different 2 hour time spans during these omitted days at
  several locations in downtown Boston.</p>

  <p>The locations will be specified as latitude, longitude points,
  and the prediction will be within a 250 meter radius of those points.

  <p>We will give you around 50 location, timespan pairs.  Your score will
  be computed as the root-mean-squared error of your predictions against the 
  ground truth.  That is, given your estimates  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Hat{p_1}\ldots \Hat{p_n}" border="0"/> for data points
   <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_1\ldots p_n" border="0"/>
   we will compute:<p><center><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{\sum_{i\in1\ldots n}{(p_i-\Hat{p_i})^2}}}" border="0"/></center></p>

  <h2>Timing</h2>

  <p>We have provided an initial training dataset which includes the
  actual number of taxi pickups on many different days and times
  throughout the city.  In addition, we have provided a an initial
  test set of locations, each specified as a lat, lon center
  coordinate and a timestamp.  For each of these points, your code
  needs to predict the number of taxi trips initiated within a 250 m
  radius of the center point and a two hour period following the
  timestamp.<p>

    <p>You can <a href="/prediction_test1">submit</a> predictions for
  this dataset as many times as you wish, and we will provide a
  leaderboard that updates your score on each submission to track
  contestant progress against each other.  The initial test dataset is
  for validation purposes only and has no effect on the final
  evaluation.</p>

  <p>In the last week of the competition, we will release a final test
  dataset on which you will be judged.  You may submit as many times
  as you wish but the final scores will be released only at the end of
  the competition.  The format of this final data set will be the same
  as the test data set but will cover a different set of locations and
  times.</p>
