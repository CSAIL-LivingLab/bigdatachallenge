  The goal of this challenge is to predict taxi demand (total # of taxi trips) in downtown Boston based on historical taxi data and other related data sets (weather, events, social media data).

  <p>
  We have collected 1 month worth of data (see below for descriptions
  of the datasets).  In this challenge we will give you all of the data
  except for several days of taxi data that we leave out.  Your job is 
  to predict the total number of taxi trips within a 2 hour time span at
  several locations in downtown Boston.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center"><a href="/datasets"><button>Download the datasets here</button></a></p>

  <h2>Specification</h2>

  <p>The time spans will be drawn from the days of taxi data that we
  left out

  <p>The locations will be specified as latitude, longitude points,
  and the prediction will be within a 250 meter radius of those points.


  <p>We will give you around 50 location, timespan pairs.  Your score will
  be computed as the mean-squared error of your predictions against the 
  ground truth.

  <h2>Timing</h2>

  <p>The prediction challenge will XXX.  We will provide a training
  dataset for you to construct models.  Then on YYY date we will
  release an initial test dataset and provide N locations, specified
  by lat, lon bounding boxes and a time window, for you to predict
  the number of taxi routes initiated within the window.  You can <a
  href="#submit">submit</a> predictions for this dataset as many times
  as you wish, and we will provide a leaderboard that updates your
  score on each submission to track contestant progress against each
  other.  The initial test dataset is for validation purposes only
  and has no effect on the final evaluation.</p>

  <p>In the last week of the competition, we will release the final test
  dataset for which contestants will be ultimately compared.  You may
  submit as many times as you wish but the final scores will be release
  only at the end of the competition.</p>
