  The goal of this challenge is to predict taxi demand (total # of taxi trips) in downtown Boston based on historical taxi data and other related data sets (weather, events, social media data).

  <p>
  We have collected 2 months worth of data (see below for descriptions
  of the datasets).  In this challenge we will give you all of the data
  except for several days of taxi data that we leave out.  Your job is 
  to predict the total number of taxi trips within a number different 2 hour time spans during these omitted days at
  several locations in downtown Boston.</p>

  <p>The locations will be specified as latitude, longitude points,
  and the prediction will be within a 250 meter radius of those points.

  <p>We will give you around 50 location, timespan pairs.  Your score will
  be computed as the root-mean-squared error of your predictions against the 
  ground truth.  That is, given your estimates  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Hat{p_1}\ldots \Hat{p_n}" border="0"/> for data points
   <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p_1\ldots p_n" border="0"/>
  we will compute:<p><center><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sqrt{\sum_{i\in1\ldots n}{(p_i-\Hat{p_i})^2}}" border="0"/></center></p>

  <h2>Timing</h2>

  <p>We will provide an initial training
  dataset for you to construct models, along with an
   an initial test dataset and set of N locations, specified
  by lat, lon center coordinates and time, for you to predict
  the number of taxi trips initiated within the two hour period following that time within a 250 m radius of the center point.  You can <a
  href="#submit">submit</a> predictions for this dataset as many times
  as you wish, and we will provide a leaderboard that updates your
  score on each submission to track contestant progress against each
  other.  The initial test dataset is for validation purposes only
  and has no effect on the final evaluation.</p>

  <p>In the last week of the competition, we will release the final test
  dataset on which contestants will be ultimately compared.  You may
  submit as many times as you wish but the final scores will be released
  only at the end of the competition.</p>
