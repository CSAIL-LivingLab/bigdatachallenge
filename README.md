MIT CSAIL Big Data Challenge
======================

The challenge is hosted by MIT CSAIL's [http://istc-bigdata.org](ISTC)
initiative and seeks to develop innovative prediction algorithms and awesome
visualizations for the City of Boston's transportation department.

Help your city better understand their traffic patterns!


Prediction Challenge
============

Predict the demand for taxis within a 5 mile radius of a random location in
Boston during a given time window (e.g., 11pm to 2am third thursday of April
2013), given the current events that day, commercial renvue information, and
the tweet stream immediately before the time window.

We have collected a month worth of data (see below for descriptions of the
datasets).   We will provide two weeks worth of training data and draw the test
data randomly from the remaining two weeks of data.

Visualization Challenge
===============

Visualize the data in a meaningful way.

We will have a judging panel consisting of visualization experts, data
scientists, Boston Transportation people.
