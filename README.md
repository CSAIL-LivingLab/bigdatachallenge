MIT CSAIL Big Data Challenge
======================

The challenge is hosted by MIT CSAIL's [http://istc-bigdata.org](ISTC)
initiative and seeks to develop innovative prediction algorithms and awesome
visualizations for the City of Boston's transportation department.

Help your city better understand their traffic patterns!


Prediction Challenge
============

TODO: think about the specifics of the prediction result, and the model inputs
(discretized?  in what way?

Predict expected number of taxi rides on all blocks within a 5 mile radius of a random
street corner location in Boston during a given time window discretized to 15
minute intervals (e.g., 11pm to 2:15am third thursday of April 2013), given the
current events that day, commercial renvue information, and the tweet stream
immediately before the time window.

We have collected a month worth of data (see below for descriptions of the
datasets).   We will provide two weeks worth of training data and draw the test
data randomly from the remaining two weeks of data.

Visualization Challenge
===============

Visualize the data in a meaningful way.

We will have a judging panel consisting of visualization experts, data
scientists, Boston Transportation people.


Prizes
=======

Money Galore!!


The Datasets
==========

TODO: describe the datasets in more detail

* **MBTA demand**
* **Boston taxi cab data**: All
* **Local events data**: Boston events information (location, event type, description, category, etc)
* **Commercial venue data**: categorization and descriptions of all Boston commercial venues, including GPS locations.
* **Tweet stream**: all geocoded tweets within the Greater Boston area.
